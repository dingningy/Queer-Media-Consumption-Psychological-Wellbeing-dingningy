	abstract = {This paper explores the role of media among different generations of non-straight men. Based on generational theory, combining the notions of “queer generations” and “media generations,” it empirically explores the role of both legacy and digital media in the processes of sexual identity formation in four post-war generations (Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z). A mixed-method approach was used, combining a quantitative survey ( N  =  684) to measure the importance of different media with in-depth interviews ( N  =  80) to better understand the role of media in relation to sexual identity. The results show significant generational differences in the importance of media used at the time of sexual identity exploration as well as in the past year. Digital media became increasingly important for the younger generations but also play a key role in the sexual lives of older participants, while film and television remain important sources of representation, across all generations.},

	abstract = {Consumers have become attracted to "exotic" or culturally related trends. By extracting and consuming styles and characteristics associated with marginalized cultures, society eliminates diversity through homogenization. Recently popular television programs such as {\textless}em{\textgreater}Queer Eye for the Straight Guy{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, which depicts the make-over of a straight male by five gay hosts, displays characteristics associated with the gay community allowing for the absorption of stereotypes. Following this, the configuration of the "metrosexual" by marketers has allowed straight males to adopt the positive queer styles. Discussion groups were convened to view an episode of {\textless}em{\textgreater}Queer Eye{\textless}/em{\textgreater} to discuss the program and the portrayal of gay images. Focus groups indicate that the program is a positive sign of acceptance although it reinforces mainstream stereotypes. Both {\textless}em{\textgreater}Queer Eye{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and the metrosexual are a result of the break down heterosexual gender norms and production and redistribution of stereotypes which generate profit in a consumer society. Instead of dispelling stereotypes, programs like {\textless}em{\textgreater}Queer Eye {\textless}/em{\textgreater}re-inscribe and validate these images. While the presence of gay characters in the media shows a movement towards greater acceptance of homosexuality, the commodification of gay stereotypes demonstrates the hegemonic nature of mass culture and the justification of exploitation through tolerance.},
