# The Effects of Chatbot Gender on Consumer Buying Intention for Products: Human-AI Interactions in the E-Commerce Context

Final Research Project for Data to Manuscript in R

***Introduction***

Imagine navigating an online store, where the chatbot not only provides product recommendations based on your needs but also interacts with you like a friend—how does the perceived gender of this chatbot affect your buying intention for different products? Entering the Web 3.0 era, chatbot sales agents are frequently encountered across e-commerce platforms, transforming consumer behavior substantially. Though prior studies have indicated that chatbot’s anthropomorphic features could significantly increase consumers’ buying intention for products, few explored the impact of chatbot gender on their buying intention for different product categories. Understanding how to effectively match chatbot gender with consumer gender across different product categories is crucial to improving consumers’ online shopping experiences and buying intentions, which leads to better sales outcomes.
