# Abstract
 The pink tax is a gender-based price discrimination in which women are usually charged 
more than men for products and services with the same efficacy. Previous studies have indicated 
that women showed significantly lower price fairness perceptions of daily necessities (utilitarian) 
products with the pink tax than men, which may lead to lower buying intentions. The present study 
expands the research by examining whether the pink tax’s negative effects on female consumers’ 
price fairness perceptions and buying intentions persist for luxury products. Additionally, this study 
also investigates the pink tax’s impacts on women’s attitudes toward work. By adopting a 2 (price: 
pink tax vs. equal) ×2 (product category: utilitarian vs. luxury) mixed design with product category 
as the repeated variable (N = 228), the current study compared female participants’ price fairness 
perceptions and buying intentions for both utilitarian and luxury products, and their attitudes toward 
work under the pink tax with those who exposed to equal prices. The findings revealed that though 
female participants had significantly lower price fairness perceptions and buying intentions for both 
utilitarian and luxury products under the pink tax, these negative impacts were more prominent for 
utilitarian than luxury products, indicating the product category’s moderating effect. Meanwhile, the 
results indicated that female participants were more likely to show negative attitudes toward work 
under the pink tax. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the pink tax’s 
negative impacts on female consumers’ purchase decision-making and work attitudes as employees, 
calling for companies to engage in practices that eliminate the pink tax and human resource 
management to narrow the gender pay gap and alleviate the pink tax’s economic burden on women.
