abstract: |

  | The growing visibility of the LGBTQ+ community is accompanied by the flourishing of queer characters in media in the information era. While previous studies have explored the double-edged impact of queer media representation on LGBTQ+ individuals’ development, few have compared these effects across different LGBTQ+ subgroups. This study investigates queer media characters’ psychological impacts on LGBTQ+ individuals with different identities, examining the relationship between perceived character authenticity, intersectionality, and characters’ impacts on LGBTQ+ individuals’ psychological well-being using a reliable survey instrument in a worldwide sample. 
  
  | Findings revealed that marginal groups within the LGBTQ+ community, including those from developing countries, gender minorities, and racial minorities, reported higher scores about queer media characters’ positive impacts on psychological well-being compared to their mainstream counterparts. However, in terms of sexual orientation, mainstream groups (i.e., gay and lesbian respondents) showed higher scores. Importantly, the study found strong positive correlations between authenticity ratings, intersectionality ratings, and scores of queer characters’ positive impacts on psychological well-being. 
   
  | This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of LGBTQ+ individuals' diverse needs and experiences with queer media representation, which has significant implications for media producers, mental health professionals, and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups in fostering more positive and inclusive media representations for the LGBTQ+ community.

Since the Stonewall riots, queer characters have flourished in the mass media, reaching their peak in the information era. As the primary audience for queer media characters, the LGBTQ+ community is claimed to be both positively and negatively impacted by these characters [e.g., @craig_media:_2015;@nolke_making_2018]. While queer characters can favorably impact LGBTQ+ individuals’ identity development and self-esteem, stereotypical representations that lack intersectionality may result in stigmatization and negative mental outcomes. Nevertheless, few studies have compared queer characters’ impacts on different LGBTQ+ subgroups, probably because they ignored the emergence of more marginal groups (e.g., asexual). Additionally, no established instruments have explored how perceived character authenticity or intersectionality may contribute to different psychological well-being outcomes. Knowing LGBTQ+ individuals' diverse needs and experiences with queer media representation is important as it can call for more diverse and inclusive queer media representations. Through developing a reliable instrument on queer media characters’ psychological impacts and conducting worldwide data collection across different LGBTQ+ generations, this study aimed to contribute to a deeper understanding of queer characters’ psychological impacts on different LGBTQ+ groups.
